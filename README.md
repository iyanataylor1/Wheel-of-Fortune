# Wheel-of-Fortune
Data Structures group project

This project aimed to exercise our understanding of data structures and apply the concepts taught. 

The PDF contains information about each member's contributions to the project, reasons for using each data structure for certain components, worst-case asymptotic analysis of the key features/ modules used in the system, developer notes and improvement suggestions, and the application user manual.

This project is not hosted via a third party; the source files must be downloaded, compiled and run locally to play this version of the game. Keep all game source code files in one directory, keep the puzzle source code in another directory, both directories must be contained in the same parent directory.
